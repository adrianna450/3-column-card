## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little more about css flexboxes were a real time saver as I feel it did not take as long as the last project. I do still get the cross axis and main axis mixed up, but I think I am slowly getting the hang of it.

### Continued development

I feel that I am a little bit more comfortable with css and flexboxes so I am moving on to css frameworks and javascript as my next projects.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This website gave me a simple referecne to flexboxes that I could look back on quickly.
- [resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Since I am learning Css over again, this was a helpful resource for looking up things that I forgot.
